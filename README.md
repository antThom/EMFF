# EMFF
This repo will have just about everything needed to get the EMFF project off the ground. This does not contain any of the Motion
Capture Software, but it does include all Ros packages and all Arduino code. You should also be able to find documents of the
types of communication and commands between the ground station and the various vehicles.
